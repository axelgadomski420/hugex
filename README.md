## Run hugex 

higex runs locally and uses Docker to provide runtime environments for coding agents.

Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your machine.

To run hugex, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Hugex application, and you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:5173`


## Using hugex

Once the app is running you can connect your Github account to see private repos.

After connecting, chose a repo and submit a task for the coding agent to work on.
